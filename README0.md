# Browser Games

A collection of games to play in a web browser. See the full list of games in the [games.md](games.md) file.

This weeks work can be found on the development branch and not master. This is my second week doing this goal, the old goal is in a folder in the browser-games directory named 'old_game'

## Installation and Setup

Clone the repo, install npm dependencies, and start the server:

```shell-session
$ git clone git@github.com:GuildCrafts/browser-games.git
$ cd browser-games
$ npm install

...

$ npm start
...
Starting up http-server, serving ./public
Available on:
  http://127.0.0.1:4321
  http://10.0.1.11:4321
```

Then open `http://localhost:4321/` in your browser of choice and play away!
